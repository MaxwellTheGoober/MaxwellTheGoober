## Welcome to the README/introduction!
You seem to have found my Github profile, from discord perhaps, or vencord/equicord comments.
If so, you should probably add me on discord, as I dont really do much stuff here, Although, If you have a mutual server with me,
Ping me in the server you found me, as I do not friend unknown people.
I usually tend to talk quite a lot, and am usually active most of the time.
If I dont respond, Assume that I'm asleep, Reach out if you want.
Some platforms i'm on are Discord, Bluesky, Matrix, Roblox, Steam, and Flashpoint.
:3.
