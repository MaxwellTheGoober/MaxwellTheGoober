## Welcome to the README/introduction!
You seem to have found my Github profile, from discord perhaps, or vencord/equicord comments.
If so, you should probably add me on discord, as I dont really do much stuff here, Although, If you have a mutual server with me,
Ping me in the server you found me, as I do not friend unknown people.
I usually tend to talk quite a lot, and am usually active most of the time.
If I dont respond, Assume that I'm asleep, Reach out if you want.
Some platforms i'm on are Discord, Bluesky, Matrix, Roblox, Steam, and Flashpoint.
Go to my discord to find some of them, Add me on some if you want, however you may be declined if you don't properly introduce yourself first.
